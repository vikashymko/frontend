              <h3>“Exotic” Leather</h3>
              <p class="date">2024-12-12</p>
              <p class="description">
                When one thinks of “exotic” leather, their first thought 
                may be of expensive designer bags made from strange materials 
                or advanced techniques. A wide range of animal hides fit 
                under the category of “exotic,” including crocodile, alligator, 
                ostrich, snake, eels, and even stingrays. The common factor 
                here is that these hides are not easy to get ahold of and are 
                not as common as typical animal hides, making them incredibly expensive.

              <h3>Buffalo (Bison) Leather</h3>
              <p class="date">2024-12-12</p>
              <p class="description">
                Bison leather, or buffalo as it is sometimes called, is another 
                popular type of leather with a long history that stretches 
                back to Native American traditions. Like cow leather, buffalo 
                leather is produced by farm-raised animals. It is a secondary 
                item, while buffalo meat is the primary item. Buffalo leather 
                tends to have a higher tensile strength than cow leather and 
                often has a grainier texture. At Montana Leather Company, we 
                provide a wide assortment of buffalo leathers that can be used 
                for bags, clothing, and more.

              <h3>Cow Leather</h3>
              <p class="date">2024-12-12</p>
              <p class="description">
                Cowhide leather is the most obvious animal hide because it is 
                so common and abundant. Valued for its sturdiness and reliability, 
                cowhide is best known for producing everyday products like 
                bags, belts, and heavy-duty boots. With such an abundance of 
                cowhide leather, it is a good place to start as you learn through 
                trial and error.

            <h2>Tools</h2>
            <p>
                An essential toolkit should include a leather hole punch, 
                scissors, a rotary cutter, and a stitching awl. A gluing 
                leather adhesive is also a must-have.

            <h2>Materials</h2>
            <p>
                Start with a scrap leather piece to practice without wasting 
                precious material. You could experiment with cow leather or 
                sheep leather as these are beginner-friendly options.
