              <h3>Clean Regularly</h3>
              <p>
                Use a soft, damp cloth to gently remove dirt and dust. For 
                deeper cleaning, use a leather-specific cleaner to avoid 
                damaging the material.

              <h3>Condition the Leather</h3>
              <p>
                Apply a high-quality leather conditioner every few months to keep 
                the leather supple and prevent it from drying out or cracking.

              <h3>Protect from Moisture</h3>
              <p>
                Avoid exposing leather to excessive water. If it gets wet, 
                blot it dry with a soft cloth and let it air-dry naturally, 
                away from direct heat.

              <h3>Store Properly</h3>
              <p>
                Keep leather items in a cool, dry place. Use dust bags 
                for storage, and avoid overcrowding to prevent creases 
                or deformation.

              <h3>Avoid Prolonged Sunlight</h3>
              <p>
                Protect leather from prolonged exposure to direct sunlight, 
                which can cause fading and drying. Use UV-protective sprays 
                if necessary.
